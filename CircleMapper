'''
This code should find the points on a fits image that line up with the coords defined in CircleGenerator.py

TODO: Find a way to define the size of circles needed
      Import multiple fits files (consider array stacking with numpy)
      Figure out system to quantify results (average, highest etc)

def mapper():

    '''
    Function: 
        mapper

    Purpose: 
        maps a set of coordinates onto an array, taking average value of pixels selected
        Finds difference between two circles to produce a "Gradient"
        Currently uses the circlegenerator function but this could be changed in future to allow more diverse mapping

    Inputs: 
        Image in FITS format (Not able to be specified outside of the code for the time being)
        radius (Currently set by user input)

    Outputs: 
        ColourGradient (float): takes difference of the inner and outer circles to produce a gradient
                                - more negative value indicates a gradient towards blue at the outer edge
                                - more positive value indicates a gradient towards red at the outer edge
                                - greater the absolute value, the bigger the difference in colour

    Current method of determining radius, official value "Should" be obtainable via the hubble gz meta data file once I find it
    !!Bear in mind the resolution of the picture being used!!
    Radius is input as a number of pixels, so if source is 0.12" wide, and the resolution is 0.03" (Like ACS I think) then the radius is 2 pixels

    print("Colour gradient of source is " + ColourGradient) #Calculates a difference between inner and outer colour, more negative gradient means bluer outer edge

    '''
    NB FOR THE FUTURE:

    More reliable results can be gained by taking average colour at more radii, 
    potential for a loop to be used to run through all possible interger radii within bounds of the source

    Data my be difficult to quantify, but could be used for one or two galaxies to examine interesting galaxies such as 
    those with a large extent and a blue strip somewhere along the glactic disk, or for use on galaxies where there is a
    gradient towards blue toward the outer area of the galaxy
