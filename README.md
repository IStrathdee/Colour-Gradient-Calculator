# Colour-Gradient-Calculator
Code to analyse the gradient of colour over the extent of a distant galaxy (WIP)

Code should take in two images, one of each colour being examined. Circle (or ellipse) should be drawn over image at intervals, so there are three regions
First region contains the galactic core, not examined because should emit brightly over all spectrums
Second should be inner galaxy, ie half way between the core and outer edge. Average over this area determines the inner colour
Third should be the outer galaxy, ie outer half of the disk. Average over this area determines the outer colour

With inner and outer colour determined, a result should be developed with a difference
